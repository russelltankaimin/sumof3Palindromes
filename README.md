# sumof3Palindromes
Basically expresses any number of base g >=5 into a sum of 3 palindromes

This is implemented according to the algorithm provided by a paper from Javier Cilleruelo, Florian Luca and Lewis Baxter,
titled : " EVERY POSITIVE INTEGER IS A SUM OF 3 PALINDROMES "

Even though Christian Lawson Perfect has done one for base-10 integers and Lewis Baxter has done an applet for base 5-10 integers, 
I thought of implementing one that encompasses HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS as well.

Expected time of Project Completion : June 2020
